# Heart Disease Analysis: Understanding Key Risk Indicators

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a dataset of heart disease patients to identify key risk indicators and understand their relationships with heart disease. Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally, and this analysis seeks to uncover patterns and correlations among various health metrics and demographic factors.

### Dataset Information
The dataset consists of **920 rows** and **16 columns**, encompassing a range of health indicators such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, age, and other relevant demographic information. 

### Key Findings
- **Target Variable:** The analysis reveals that **55.4%** of patients have heart disease, while **44.6%** do not.
- **Demographics:** The age of patients ranges from **22 to 77 years**, with a gender distribution of **78.9% male** and **21.1% female**.
- **Health Metrics:** Average and median values for key health indicators are provided, including:
  - Resting blood pressure (average: 132, median: 130)
  - Serum cholesterol (average: 199.13, median: 223)
  - Maximum heart rate (average: 137.5, median: 140)
- **Categorical Features:** The analysis includes insights into exercise-induced angina and the distribution of different types of chest pain among patients using boxplot.
- **Visual Analysis:** Visualizations illustrate the age distribution of patients and compare average cholesterol levels between those with and without heart disease using scatterplot.
- **Outliers:** The presence of outliers in cholesterol and resting blood pressure measurements is examined, with visual representations highlighting these anomalies using scatterplot.

### Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the key risk indicators associated with heart disease, contributing to a better understanding of the factors that may influence its development. The findings can aid in the formulation of strategies for early detection and prevention.
